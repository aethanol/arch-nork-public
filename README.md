# Architected Nork

This repository contains two versions of a simple text-based game called Nork, developed as part of a [course](http://arch-joelross.rhcloud.com/) at the UW iSchool. 

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission!


##### 1. Did you work with a partner? If so, who?
> Liam and Ethan were partners for arch-nork.



##### 2. Discuss how the different architectural styles affected the implementation of your program. Was one pattern easier to use or more effective _for this problem_? Why? How do the different styles influence the ability to add new features or modify existing functionality? What kind of changes would be easier or harder with each style?
##### This discussion should be a couple of paragraphs, giving a detailed analysis of how the styles work.
> Answer goes here!



##### 3. Did you add an extra features to either version of your game? If so, what?
> We implemented the nork game with a peer to peer architecture, in order to illustrate the action of having multiple peers connecting to eachother without a centralized server we created a messaging system in which a peer can directly transmit to targeted peers, or a global messaging system that messages every peer in the swarm.



##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> We each spent approximately 



##### 5. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####

##### 6. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
